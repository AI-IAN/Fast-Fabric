def convert_currency(amount, from_currency, to_currency, transaction_date):
    for attempt in range(3):
        try:
            rate = currency_api.get_rate(from_currency, to_currency, transaction_date, timeout=15)
            return amount * rate
        except APITimeoutException:
            if attempt < 2:
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
                continue
            else:
                # Fallback to cached rate with logging
                cached_rate = get_cached_rate(from_currency, to_currency, transaction_date)
                log_fallback_usage(from_currency, to_currency, transaction_date)
                return amount * cached_rate
